# Ask a question
We monitor the Github issues section specifically for bugs found with our workshops and samples, however we will reply to questions 
asked using Github issues too.

The Azure IoT team monitors Stack Overflow, especially the [azure-iot-hub](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-iot-hub) 
tag. It is a great place to ask questions specifically about the various SDKs.

# File a bug (code or documentation)
Bugs are definitely something we want to hear about! Please open an issue on github and we'll try address it as fast as possible. 
Here's the information we would like from you to get started:
- What sample are you using (NodeJS/JavaScript, C, C#, F#, Python, Java)
- Do you have a snippet of code that would help us reproduce the bug?
- Do you have logs showing what's happening?

Our workshop and samples are entirely open-source and we do accept pull-requests if you feel like taking a stab at fixing the bug 
and maybe adding your name to our commit history :) Please be sure to file an issues first and mention the relevant issue number 
in your pull request description.

# Contribute documentation
For simple markdown files, we accept documentation pull requests submitted against the `master` branch, if it's about existing workshop 
or sample.  If your PR is about adding workshops, sample changes or has changes to the comments in the code itself, we'll treat is as 
a code change (see the next section).  If you are adding images or other content files for documentation, please place them in an 
`assest` folder at the same level as the readme.

# Contribute code
Unlike documentation, we require pull-requests for code to be submitted against the `develop` branch in order to review. We try 
to maintain a high bar for code quality and maintainability, we request that all code samples are accompanied by documentation and 
example scenerios.

Also, have you signed the [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/) ([CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/))? A friendly bot 
will remind you about it when you submit your pull-request.

If you feel like your contribution is going to be a major effort, you should probably give us a heads-up. So before you spend the time, 
just check with us to make sure your plans and ours are in sync :) Just open an issue on github and tag it with "enhancement" or 
"feature request".

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
